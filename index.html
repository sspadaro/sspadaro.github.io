          The infinity diagram is separated into five clusters: problems, clubs, events, 
          features, and solutions/details. The "problems" cluster includes problems that branch
          of the main problem statement. The "clubs" cluster provides several organizations that could
          be represented on the app, which is one of the solutions found in the "solutions/details" cluster. 
          The "events" cluster lists events that students would want to learn more about. The "features" group 
          suggests possible features that could make finding the information about organizations easier to 
          find. The last cluster, "solutions/details" provides extra ideas that could help to solve the problem.
